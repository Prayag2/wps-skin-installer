# WPS Skin Installer
This script will let you install your favourite WPS Office skin in Linux! I do NOT own any skin. All the skins were made by Kingsoft and belong to Kingsoft. This script will only let you INSTALL those skins because you can't do that on Linux by default.  
Note: This will only work with the Flatpak version of WPS Office.
